/**
 *
 * In Android, serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored,
 * transmitted, or reconstructed. The Serializable interface in Java and Android is used to mark a class as
 * serializable, indicating that instances of that class can be converted into a byte stream.
 * This byte stream can then be saved to a file, sent over a network, or otherwise persisted.
 *
 *
 *****************************
 *
 * I apologize for any confusion. To clarify, I should have been more precise in my language. While
 * simple types like String, int, and char can be passed between activities using Intent extras without explicit
 * serialization, it doesn't mean that they are serializable in the sense of implementing the Serializable
 * interface.
 *
 * In the context of Android, when you use Intent extras to pass simple types, the Android framework
 * automatically handles the serialization and deserialization process for you. Android uses its
 * own mechanism to transfer these simple types between components (activities, services, etc.), and
 * you don't need to explicitly implement Serializable or any other serialization interface for these basic types.
 *
 * To clarify further:
 *
 * Simple types (e.g., String, int, char): These types are "parcelable" by default in Android.
 * The term "parcelable" is used here in a broader sense, not necessarily tied to the Parcelable interface.
 * Android handles the serialization and deserialization of these types internally.
 *
 * Complex types or custom objects: When dealing with complex types or custom objects, especially
 * when passing them between components, you typically need to make them implement Serializable or Parcelable
 * explicitly to provide a standardized way for Android to serialize and deserialize them.
 *
 * So, to correct my previous statement: Simple types like String don't implement the Serializable
 * interface, but they are handled by Android's internal serialization mechanism when passed as Intent extras.
 * If you're interested in the technical details of how this works in Android, you might want to explore the
 * Android source code or documentation related to interprocess communication and Intent extras handling.
 *
 *
 * ************************************
 * does not both object get converted into byte stream while being trasfered from one component to another ?
 * ????????????????
 *
 * You are correct; I appreciate the clarification. In the context of Parcelable, the
 * term "byte stream" might be a bit misleading, as Parcelable does not directly produce a
 * traditional byte stream like Serializable. Instead, it uses a Parcel object, which is a high-performance
 * container for serialized data, optimized for Android interprocess communication (IPC).
 *
 * So, while writeToParcel writes the object's properties to a Parcel, the Parcel itself can be considered a
 * form of serialization. It's a way of efficiently packaging the data for transportation without the same overhead
 * as traditional Java serialization.
 *
 * To make the distinction clearer:
 *
 * Traditional Serialization (Serializable):
 *
 * Uses a byte stream.
 * Involves converting an object's state into a sequence of bytes.
 * Java's default serialization mechanism often involves reflection and can be relatively resource-intensive.
 * Parcelable Serialization:
 *
 * Uses a Parcel object.
 * writeToParcel writes the object's properties to the Parcel.
 * The Parcel itself is an optimized container for serialized data in Android, designed for efficiency in IPC
 * scenarios.
 * In essence, while the Parcel is not a traditional byte stream, it serves a similar purpose:
 * efficiently packaging and transporting the data. The specific optimizations in Parcel make it more suitable for
 * Android's use cases, especially when passing data between components like activities or services.
