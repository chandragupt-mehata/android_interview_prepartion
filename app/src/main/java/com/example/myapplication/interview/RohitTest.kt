/*
Design a Credit Card Parser function that will check if a credit card number is valid or not.
Return the name of the issuer if the card is valid. Return null if invalid.
Validity is determined by two values and two criteria.
Value 1: The card number. Example: "3796-1111-2222-1122"
Value 2: The expiration date. Example: "11/22"
Criteria 1: The first four digits identify match an issuer from the following set:
-- ACME: starts with 1121
-- ALFA: starts with 1111
-- AMEX: starts with 3796
Criteria 2: The MM/YY expiration date matches the last four digits.
Example: "3796-1111-2222-1122" and "11/22" is valid. Return "Amex".

 *
 * what is immutability in Kotlin ?
 * Immutability in Kotlin refers to the concept where the state of an object cannot be modified after it has been created. Immutability is important for
 * ensuring that objects remain consistent and predictable, especially in concurrent or parallel programming.
 * In Kotlin, immutability can be achieved through the use of val for read-only properties and immutable data structures. Here are some key aspects of
 * immutability in Kotlin:
 *
 * how immutability affect thread safety
 * how immutability affect concurrency
 * Immutability plays a crucial role in ensuring thread safety. When an object is immutable, its state cannot change after it is created.
 * This has several beneficial implications for concurrent programming:
 *
 * No Need for Synchronization
 * No Race Conditions: Since immutable objects cannot be modified, there is no risk of race conditions where multiple threads attempt to read and
 * write shared data simultaneously.
 *
 * kotlin
 * Copy code
 * val immutableList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
 * // No matter how many threads access this list, it will always be the same.
 * Simplified Concurrency
 * Simplified Concurrency: With immutable objects, you don't need to use complex synchronization mechanisms (like locks or semaphores) to protect shared
 * state, simplifying code and reducing the potential for deadlocks and other concurrency issues.
 *
 * kotlin
 * Copy code
 * class ImmutablePerson(val name: String, val age: Int)
 *
 * val person = ImmutablePerson("Alice", 30)
 * // This instance of ImmutablePerson can be safely shared between threads.
 * Safe Sharing of Data
 * Safe Sharing of Data: Immutable objects can be freely shared between threads without the risk of one thread altering the state in a way that affects
 * other threads. This leads to more predictable and reliable multi-threaded code.

 * //vZio interview questions
 * Please find the below question asked in  Vizio Interview :
 * Past project experience ?
 * What is MVVM?
 * How we can make network call?
 * In the case of multiple module project what will be the scope of singleton?
 * What is inline, crossline in kotlin?
 * How to check the type of generics at runtime?
 * Why compose is better ?
 * How to call coroutine from compose?
 * What is side effect? How these side effect behave at the time of configuration changes?
 * How to save UI state?
 * In the case of system initiated process death how you can persist the data?
 * Where you used Hot flow and cold flow in your project?
 * Cold Flow: Fetching and displaying the message history when a user opens a chat screen.
 * Each time the screen is opened, the flow will start from the beginning and fetch messages from the database. (considering flow object creation is
 * not being re created on each navigation because if that occurs then in case of hot flow, like shared flow, object would be new for each navigation and
 * flow will be re start for each times.)
 *
 *
 * Difference between Hot Flow and Cold flow?
 * Difference between shared flow and state flow?
 * Why data flow in compose is unidirectional?
 * How you can share the data between two screen ?
 * How view model handle configuration changes and system initiated process death?
 * What is shared view model?
 * How you implement shared view model for two screens?
 * What is live data?
 * What is singleton design pattern?
 * Where you used singleton in your project?
 * Asked follow up questions(scenario based) on the answers.

 * Context is a reference to the current state or environment of your app. Itâ€™s what your app uses to interact with the Android system.
 * If your app is like a person, then context is like the surroundings or environment that person is in. It helps the person know where they are and
 * what they can interact with.
