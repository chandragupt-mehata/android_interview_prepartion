/**
 * Object-Oriented Programming or Java OOPs concept refers to languages that use objects in programming, they
 * use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or
 * user, performing tasks you assign.
 *
 * Abstraction in Java is the process in which we only show essential details/functionality to the user.
 *
 * Java Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and
 * only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.
 *
 * It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit
 * the features(fields and methods) of another class.
 * Why Do We Need Java Inheritance?
 * 1. Code Reusability: The code written in the Superclass is common to all subclasses.
 * Child classes can directly use the parent class code.
 * 2. Method Overriding: Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance.
 * It is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.
 * 3. Abstraction: The concept of abstract where we do not have to provide all details,
 * is achieved through inheritance. Abstraction only shows the functionality to the user.
