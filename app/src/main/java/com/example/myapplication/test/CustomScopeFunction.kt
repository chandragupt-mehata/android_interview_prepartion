/**
 * The Kotlin standard library contains several functions whose sole purpose is to execute a block of code within the context of an object. When
 * you call such a function on an object with a lambda expression provided, it forms a temporary scope. In this scope, you can access the object without
 * its name. Such functions are called scope functions. There are five of them: let, run, with, apply, and also.
 *
 * let it be
 * "Also": Youâ€™re doing something "in addition" to the object, so you need to refer back to the object with it.

// - if we want to use this then create lambda as extension function of T so that it will have this

// If we use let or other scope fn which provide reference to context object then above problem will get solved in such chained scope function.
