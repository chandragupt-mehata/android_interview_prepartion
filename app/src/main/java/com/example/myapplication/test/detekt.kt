/**
 * detekt, a static code analysis tool for Kotlin, helps you do all of this.
 * It comes with a wide range of rule sets. It provides you with options to configure them, as well as
 * the ability to add your own custom rules. So, adding this as a part of your CI steps can prove to be beneficial.
 *
 * detekt has several features that make it a worthwhile addition to your project:
 *
 * It offers code-smell analysis for Kotlin projects.
 * It’s highly configurable — you can customize it according to your own needs.
 * You can suppress findings if you don’t want warnings for everything.
 * IDE, SonarQube and GitHub Actions integration.
 * You can specify code-smells threshold to break your builds or print warnings.
 * You can add code-smell baseline and suppression for legacy projects.
 *
 * ************* ************
 * Rule Sets
 * Comments: It provides rules that address issues in comments and documentation of the code.
 * It checks header files, comments on private methods and undocumented classes, properties or methods.
 *
 * Complexity: This set contains rules that report complex code.
 * It checks for complex conditions, methods, expressions and classes, as well as reports long methods
 * and long parameter lists.
 *
 * Coroutines: The coroutines rule set analyzes code for potential coroutines problems.
 *
 * Empty-Blocks: It contains rules that report empty blocks of code. Examples include empty catch blocks,
 * empty class blocks, empty function and conditional function blocks.
 *
 * Exceptions: It reports issues related to how code throws and handles exceptions.
 * For example, it has rules if you’re catching generic exceptions among other issues
 * related to handling exceptions.
 *
 * Formatting: This checks if your codebase follows a specific formatting rule set.
 * It allows checking indentation, spacing, semicolons or even import ordering, among other things.
 *
 * Naming: It contains rules which assert the naming of different parts of the codebase.
 * It checks how you name your classes, packages, functions and variables.
 * It reports the errors in case you’re not following the set conventions.
 *
 * Performance: It analyzes code for potential performance problems.
 * Some of the issues it reports include the use of ArrayPrimitives or misuse of forEach loop, for instance.
 *
 * Potential-Bugs: The potential-bugs rule set provides rules that detect potential bugs.
 *
 * Style: The style rule set provides rules that assert the style of the code.
 * This will help keep code in line with the given code style guidelines.
