 * ************ uni direction vs bi direction ************************
 * You're right to focus on the concept of data and its role in determining whether the flow is unidirectional or bidirectional. In architectural patterns like MVVM and MVI, data refers to the state of the application—any information that the View (UI) presents to the user and that the ViewModel or Model manages. Let's break this down further.
 *
 * 1. What Is "Data" in This Context?
 * In the context of MVVM and MVI, "data" generally refers to the following:
 *
 * State Objects: Represent the current state of the UI. For example, a data class that holds the state of a form, like whether a field is valid, what the user has entered, and what error messages (if any) should be displayed.
 *
 * LiveData/Observable Data: These are special objects in frameworks like Android that hold data and notify observers (usually the View) when that data changes. The ViewModel updates this data, and the View reacts to those changes.
 *
 * UI Data: Any data that the ViewModel exposes to the View for rendering on the UI, such as lists of items, text, or error messages.
 *
 * Events/Actions/Intents: User actions (e.g., button clicks, text input) that trigger changes in the data flow. These are not data per se, but they initiate the flow of data through the system.
 *
 * 2. Data Flow and Its Impact on Unidirectional vs. Bidirectional:
 * The data flow—whether unidirectional or bidirectional—depends on how data moves between the components (View, ViewModel, Model) and who can modify it. The architecture (MVVM, MVI) and the tools you use (LiveData, State, etc.) influence this flow.
 *
 * Unidirectional Flow (Controlled Flow):
 * ViewModel manages data exclusively: In this approach, the ViewModel is the only component that can modify the data. The View can send events/actions/intents to the ViewModel, but it can't directly modify the data/state itself. The View observes the data, and when the data changes, the View updates itself accordingly.
 *
 * Flow:
 *
 * View → sends events/actions to → ViewModel → updates data/state → View observes changes.
 * Data flow is unidirectional because the View cannot modify the data; it can only observe it.
 * Tools: This approach typically uses read-only data like LiveData or immutable state objects, which prevent the View from making changes.
 *
 * Bidirectional Flow (Two-Way Binding):
 * Both View and ViewModel can influence data: In bidirectional flow, the View not only observes data but can also directly update it. For instance, in Android, two-way data binding allows the View to automatically update the ViewModel’s data, and vice versa.
 *
 * Flow:
 *
 * View ↔ ViewModel: The View and ViewModel can both read and write to the data.
 * Data flow is bidirectional because the View can influence the data directly.
 * Tools: This approach uses mutable data structures like MutableLiveData or two-way data binding frameworks, allowing both the View and ViewModel to make changes.
 *
 * 3. What Determines the Data Flow?
 * The key determinant of whether the flow is unidirectional or bidirectional isn't just the type of data object (LiveData, State, etc.) but how the data is handled and who has the authority to modify it. Here are the factors that affect data flow:
 *
 * Access Control:
 *
 * Unidirectional Flow: The ViewModel exposes data to the View in a read-only format (e.g., using LiveData instead of MutableLiveData), ensuring that only the ViewModel can modify the data.
 * Bidirectional Flow: The ViewModel exposes data in a read-write format (e.g., using MutableLiveData), allowing both the View and ViewModel to modify the data.
 * Data-Binding Approach:
 *
 * Unidirectional Flow: Data-binding is set up in such a way that the View can only observe data changes but not modify the data directly.
 * Bidirectional Flow: Data-binding is configured to allow the View to automatically update the ViewModel’s data, creating a feedback loop.
 * State Management Philosophy:
 *
 * Unidirectional Flow: The philosophy emphasizes clear boundaries between components. The ViewModel controls all state transitions, and the View is a passive observer.
 * Bidirectional Flow: The philosophy allows for more dynamic interaction, where both the View and ViewModel share responsibility for managing state.
 * 4. Conclusion:
 * The data flow—whether unidirectional or bidirectional—depends on how data is managed and accessed in the architecture. The key factors are:
 *
 * Who can modify the data? (ViewModel only vs. both ViewModel and View)
 * How is data exposed? (Read-only vs. Read-write)
 * What tools are used? (LiveData vs. MutableLiveData, state objects, data-binding frameworks)
 * So, the decision about whether the flow is unidirectional or bidirectional is based on the design choices you make in handling data access and modification, rather than on the specific data type alone.
