External Storage :
Shared External Storage: Broadly accessible by multiple apps.
Scoped External Storage: Private and app-specific within the external storage framework.
Removable Media: Additional external storage that may or may not be present depending on user configuration.
Media Store: Structured access to media files stored on the device.

Note: In Android's storage context, removable media like SD cards and USB drives can be used for both scoped external storage and traditional external storage, depending on how developers choose to utilize them.


Internal storage vs Scoped External Storage


Internal Storage
Privacy and Security:

Private to the App: Files stored in internal storage are private to the app and cannot be accessed by other apps or the user.
Path Example: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/files/ or using getFilesDir().
Permissions: No special permissions are required to read or write to internal storage.
Persistence:

Persistent Data: Data stored in internal storage remains until the app is uninstalled.
Cache Storage: There is also a cache directory in internal storage (getCacheDir()), which stores temporary files that the system can delete to free up space.
Accessibility:

App-Only Access: Only the app that created the files can access them, ensuring high security and privacy.
Storage Location:

Internal Memory: Data is stored in the device’s internal memory, separate from external storage.

Scoped External Storage
Privacy and Security:

App-Specific Directories: Scoped external storage provides app-specific directories on external storage that are private to the app.
Path Examples: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/files/ for general files and /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/cache/ for cache files.
Permissions: No special permissions are required to read or write to these directories.
Persistence:

App-Specific Data: Data in these directories is preserved until the app is uninstalled. Cache files can be cleared by the system when space is needed.
Accessibility:

App-Only Access: Although the data is stored on external storage, it is still only accessible to the app that created it, ensuring privacy.
Shared Storage: For shared data (like media files) that needs to be accessible to other apps, you must use the Media Store API and request appropriate permissions.
Storage Location:

External Storage Partition: Data is stored on the device’s external storage partition, which can be part of the internal storage partitioned to act as external storage or on a removable SD card.
Key Differences
Access Control:

Internal Storage: Completely private to the app; not accessible by any other app or user.
Scoped External Storage: Private to the app within the external storage context; not accessible by other apps but stored on external storage media.
Use Cases:

Internal Storage: Suitable for sensitive data and app configuration files that should not be exposed outside the app.
Scoped External Storage: Suitable for less sensitive data that benefits from being on external storage, such as large media files and user-generated content.
Storage Medium:

Internal Storage: Uses the device’s internal memory.
Scoped External Storage: Uses the external storage partition, which can be part of the internal memory or an external SD card.

Al though Scoped external storage can be mounted on external SD card but that's still private to app only. It can not be accessed by other app.

Here’s a detailed categorization of primary and secondary external storage, along with their relation to scoped storage and shared storage, and the necessary code to access them:

1. Primary External Storage
a) Scoped Storage
Definition: App-specific directories within the primary external storage that are private to the app.
Path Example:
Files: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/files/
Cache: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/cache/
Code to Access:
Files: File filesDir = context.getExternalFilesDir(null);
Cache: File cacheDir = context.getExternalCacheDir();
Permissions Needed: No special permissions are required, as this is private to the app.
b) Shared Storage
Definition: Public directories on primary external storage accessible by multiple apps.
Path Example:
Music: /storage/emulated/0/Music/
Pictures: /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/
Downloads: /storage/emulated/0/Download/
Code to Access:
Music: File musicDir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_MUSIC);
Pictures: File picturesDir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
Downloads: File downloadDir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS);
Permissions Needed: READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (though WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is less common in newer Android versions due to scoped storage changes).
2. Secondary External Storage (Removable Media like SD cards)
a) Scoped Storage
Definition: App-specific directories on secondary external storage (SD card) that are private to the app.
Path Example:
Files: /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/files/
Cache: /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/cache/
XXXX-XXXX represents the unique identifier of the SD card.
Code to Access:
Files:
java
Copy code
File[] externalFilesDirs = context.getExternalFilesDirs(null);
if (externalFilesDirs.length > 1) {
    File sdCardAppSpecificDir = externalFilesDirs[1];
}
Cache:
java
Copy code
File[] externalCacheDirs = context.getExternalCacheDirs();
if (externalCacheDirs.length > 1) {
    File sdCardAppCacheDir = externalCacheDirs[1];
}
Permissions Needed: No special permissions are required, as this is private to the app.
b) Shared Storage
Definition: Public directories on secondary external storage (SD card) accessible by multiple apps.
Path Example:
Music: /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Music/
Pictures: /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Pictures/
Downloads: /storage/XXXX-XXXX/Download/
Code to Access:
Music:
java
Copy code
File[] externalMusicDirs = context.getExternalFilesDirs(Environment.DIRECTORY_MUSIC);
if (externalMusicDirs.length > 1) {
    File sdCardMusicDir = externalMusicDirs[1];
}
Permissions Needed: READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.
Summary of Permissions and Access
Scoped Storage (Both Primary and Secondary):

Private to the app, no special permissions required.
Access via methods like getExternalFilesDir(), getExternalCacheDir(), and their variants.
Shared Storage (Both Primary and Secondary):

Accessible by other apps, permissions required (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE).
Access via methods like Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory().
This breakdown provides a clear structure for how external storage is categorized and accessed in Android, with specific code examples and permissions needed.

Here’s a breakdown of internal storage in Android, including scoped and shared storage (where applicable), with Kotlin code examples to access them:

1. Internal Storage (Private to the App)
a) App-Specific Files
Definition: Internal storage directories private to the app and not accessible by other apps or users.
Path Example:
Files: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/files/
Cache: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/cache/
Code to Access:
Files:
kotlin
Copy code
val filesDir: File = context.filesDir
Cache:
kotlin
Copy code
val cacheDir: File = context.cacheDir
Permissions Needed: No permissions are required, as this storage is private to the app.
b) Shared Preferences
Definition: Internal storage mechanism for storing key-value pairs that are private to the app.
Path Example:
Shared Preferences: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/shared_prefs/
Code to Access:
kotlin
Copy code
val sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
Permissions Needed: No permissions required, as shared preferences are private to the app.
c) Databases
Definition: Internal storage mechanism for storing structured data (e.g., SQLite databases) that are private to the app.
Path Example:
Databases: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/databases/
Code to Access:
kotlin
Copy code
val dbHelper = MyDatabaseHelper(context)
val database: SQLiteDatabase = dbHelper.writableDatabase
Permissions Needed: No permissions required, as databases are private to the app.
2. Internal Storage (Shared Components)
a) Content Providers
Definition: While not exactly shared storage, content providers allow apps to share internal data with other apps through a controlled interface.
Usage Example:
For sharing files with other apps via a content provider:
kotlin
Copy code
val fileUri: Uri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(context, "com.example.yourapp.fileprovider", file)
Permissions Needed:
To access content from another app's provider, you may need the relevant permissions, depending on the content being accessed (e.g., READ_CONTACTS for contacts).
Note: Internal storage itself is not inherently shared between apps, but content providers offer a way to share data between apps securely.
Summary of Permissions and Access
Internal Storage (App-Specific Files, Cache, Shared Preferences, Databases):

Private to the app. No special permissions required.
Access via methods like filesDir, cacheDir, getSharedPreferences(), and SQLite helper classes.
Internal Storage (Shared via Content Providers):

Can be shared with other apps through content providers, requiring appropriate permissions if accessing sensitive data.
This categorization outlines how internal storage in Android is primarily private to the app, with certain components (like content providers) enabling controlled data sharing.
