External Storage :
Shared External Storage: Broadly accessible by multiple apps.
Scoped External Storage: Private and app-specific within the external storage framework.
Removable Media: Additional external storage that may or may not be present depending on user configuration.
Media Store: Structured access to media files stored on the device.

Note: In Android's storage context, removable media like SD cards and USB drives can be used for both scoped external storage and traditional external storage, depending on how developers choose to utilize them.


Internal storage vs Scoped External Storage


Internal Storage
Privacy and Security:

Private to the App: Files stored in internal storage are private to the app and cannot be accessed by other apps or the user.
Path Example: /data/data/com.example.yourapp/files/ or using getFilesDir().
Permissions: No special permissions are required to read or write to internal storage.
Persistence:

Persistent Data: Data stored in internal storage remains until the app is uninstalled.
Cache Storage: There is also a cache directory in internal storage (getCacheDir()), which stores temporary files that the system can delete to free up space.
Accessibility:

App-Only Access: Only the app that created the files can access them, ensuring high security and privacy.
Storage Location:

Internal Memory: Data is stored in the device’s internal memory, separate from external storage.
Scoped External Storage
Privacy and Security:

App-Specific Directories: Scoped external storage provides app-specific directories on external storage that are private to the app.
Path Examples: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/files/ for general files and /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.yourapp/cache/ for cache files.
Permissions: No special permissions are required to read or write to these directories.
Persistence:

App-Specific Data: Data in these directories is preserved until the app is uninstalled. Cache files can be cleared by the system when space is needed.
Accessibility:

App-Only Access: Although the data is stored on external storage, it is still only accessible to the app that created it, ensuring privacy.
Shared Storage: For shared data (like media files) that needs to be accessible to other apps, you must use the Media Store API and request appropriate permissions.
Storage Location:

External Storage Partition: Data is stored on the device’s external storage partition, which can be part of the internal storage partitioned to act as external storage or on a removable SD card.
Key Differences
Access Control:

Internal Storage: Completely private to the app; not accessible by any other app or user.
Scoped External Storage: Private to the app within the external storage context; not accessible by other apps but stored on external storage media.
Use Cases:

Internal Storage: Suitable for sensitive data and app configuration files that should not be exposed outside the app.
Scoped External Storage: Suitable for less sensitive data that benefits from being on external storage, such as large media files and user-generated content.
Storage Medium:

Internal Storage: Uses the device’s internal memory.
Scoped External Storage: Uses the external storage partition, which can be part of the internal memory or an external SD card.

Al though Scoped external storage can be mounted on external SD card but that's still private to app only. It can not be accessed by other app.
